# AirQuenga site — Linear-style starter

This is a small static starter that captures the clean, centered aesthetic similar to linear.app.

Included files:
- index.html — main page
- styles.css — core styles
- script.js — tiny interactions (mobile nav + year)
- logo.svg — minimal logo

How to use
1. Preview locally:
   - Open index.html in a browser (no build step required).
   - Or run a static server: `npx http-server` or `python -m http.server 8000`.

2. Deploy with GitHub Pages:
   - Commit files to the `main` branch of the repository named `airquenga.github.io` (this repository name automatically serves pages from the root).
   - Or enable GitHub Pages in repo settings and choose the branch (main) and root folder.

3. Customize:
   - Replace the placeholder screenshot in the hero with real images or interactive components.
   - Adjust colors in `styles.css` or swap to Tailwind if you prefer a utility-first approach.
   - Add build tooling if you'd like (Vite, Next.js, etc).

Want me to push these files into your repository (AirQuenga/airquenga.github.io)? I can:
- create a branch (e.g. `linear-inspired`),
- commit the files,
- open a pull request for you to review.

Reply "Yes, push it" and I'll create the branch and push the files. If you prefer adjustments first, tell me what to change (colors, layout, sections).
